    <p>
        Rangadhithya "Adhi" Ramachandran Venkatapathy was born on 20 February 1990,[5][2][6] and R. Jeeva was born 29 June 1991. Adhi's father works at Bharathiar University while his mother comes from an agricultural background.[3] Adhi's first exposure to rap came when his neighbour showed him Michael Jackson's "Jam".[7] His interest in hip hop music started developing in the tenth grade. He uploaded
         rap songs to the internet and got positive responses from people expressing interest in his music, who also encouraged him to start rapping in Tamil.[8] His decision to rap in Tamil rather than English was made, in his words, to avoid looking like a "wannabe".[7] Adhi named his account on the video-sharing site in YouTube as "Hiphop Tamizha", with a profile picture of the Tamil poet Subramania 
         Bharati, to avoid being caught by his parents.[9] Adhi's father had initially opposed his choice to pursue music professionally.[10] He wanted Adhi to pursue higher studies, but gave him a year to do what he wanted, with the only constraint being that Adhi should not expect any help from him. After realising that Adhi was "trying to do some good work", he encouraged his son's musical interests.
        [9] Adhi then moved to Chennai to "try [his] luck".[11]Although Hiphop is a duo,[4][12] Jeeva has seldom made public appearances, thus associating the name Hiphop Tamizha with Adhi more often. Adhi told IndiaGlitz that this is due to his shyness, and compared his partner to the unseen lion in the emblem of India, which includes four lions, with only three visible.[13] Jeeva adopted the moniker Jeeva Beatz sometime after the two met in 2005.[1][9]
        Adhi studied at Chavara Vidya Bhavan and Electrical Engineering at Bannari Amman Institute of Technology. He holds a state-level rank in Tamil Nadu Common Entrance Test and is a graduate in Master of Business Administration from the Department of Management Studies, University of Madras. As of October 2014, he was doing a PhD course at Bharathiar University,[9] which he completed in June 2015.[14] Jeeva is an alumnus of Loyola College, Chennai.[15]
        On 30 November 2017, Adhi married Latchaya Devareddy, in a private ceremony at Tirupati

    <h2>Career:</h2>
    <p>  
       Adhi and Jeeva met via Orkut in 2005. They were passionate about music and decided that they should create an independent music group in India, in Tamil.[9] According to The Hindu and Hiphop Tamizha's Facebook page, Adhi had not officially founded Hiphop Tamizha until 15 February 2010.[1]
       Around the mid 2000s, Adhi released Viswaroobam Arambam,[1] the first Tamil hip hop mixtape in India.[b] It also played a major role in promoting hip hop as a part of the Tamil culture.[8] Adhi and Jeeva remained underground until they were asked by the Tamil Nadu State Election Commission
        to compose an election anthem.[18] Hiphop Tamizha's single Ezhuvoam Vaa was chosen as the official anthem for 
       Tamil Nadu's 2011 state elections,[19] and Adhi performed it at Pachaiyappa's College when Anna Hazare came there.[18] Though the song was commercially unsuccessful,[20] Adhi and Jeeva considered it at one point their "best work so far".[21]

    <h2>Commercial success:</h2>
    <p>
         Adhi composed the song "Club le Mabbu le" in his first year of college.[18] When we asked how it developed, he recalled, "I grew up watching my mother and aunts just being traditional, and when I saw girls going to bars, I immediately wrote the lyrics of that track. And through my lyrics I am raising the debate over whether we are really changing as a society or are simply aping the West."[22]
          When Adhi was living in Chennai, he met Ma Ka Pa Anand,  then an RJ at Radio Mirchi.[11] Anand allowed Adhi to perform Club le Mabbule on his radio show with beatboxer Bharadwaj Balaji (also known as Triple B).[9][23] The recording went viral, receiving over two million views within a week of its release on YouTube. Afterwards RÃ©my Martin, an international brand, was surprised by Adhi's
          determination and launched Hiphop Tamizha as an official brand.[9] "Club le Mabbule" later vaulted Hiphop Tamizha further into public view when it was criticised as portraying Tamil women in a negative light.[24]Hiphop Tamizha's debut album Hip Hop Tamizhan was released on 17 August 2012 at Sathyam Cinemas in Chennai. Publicised as "India's first Tamil hip hop album", it was launched by Purple
          Note and produced by Remy Martin, in the latter's first association with an Indian album. The music was composed by Adhi and Jeeva, with lyrics by Adhi.[19] The album was lauded by critics. Naren Weiss, writing for Zomba, called it "nothing short of a masterpiece", while Venkatrangan R of Musicperk labelled it "A must listen. Not only for the music but for the messages hidden in it."[19]
          [non-primary source needed] The album, which included Club le Mabbule, was also a commercial success, becoming the best-selling music album of 2012 on Flipkart.[25] However, Adhi lamented the fact that "Club le Mabbule" was accepted for airplay by radio channels only after its viral success, and that some of his other songs never got airplay even once.[26]In November 2013, Adhi signed an international album with Remy Martin, titled International Tamizhan, slated to feature eight tracks, including two songs by American artists Sol and Emcee Call. The album was to be released in English, Hindi and Tamil. It was initially scheduled for release on 15 August 2014;[20][27][28] however, Hiphop Tamizha instead released the album's song "Vaadi Pulla Vaadi" as a single on the same date.[29][30] In October 2014, Adhi said the album was still "under progress",[9] but confirmed in 2018 that it was altogether dropped because "independent music doesn't make big money" in Chennai.[31] In August 2020, Adhi announced a new album titled Naa Oru Alien.[32]

    <h2>Television and cinema</h2>
    <p>
        Though Adhi initially expressed no interest in singing or composing for films,[33] he and Jeeva have contributed to numerous cinematic works. Adhi sang his first film song,[33] titled "Thapellam Thappe Illai" (composed by Vijay Antony) for Naan in 2012.[34] He also sang the title track of Ethir Neechal (2013)
         (composed by Anirudh Ravichander) accompanied by Punjabi rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh.[35][36] Also in 2013, Adhi wrote "Sudden Delight", which was composed by Santhosh Narayanan and performed by Rob Mass for Soodhu Kavvum.[37][38] In May of that year, Adhi again collaborated with Anirudh Ravichander to perform the song "Chennai City Gangsta" along with Hard Kaur for Vanakkam Chennai.[39][40]
